Gitlet Project Proposal

Classes:
•	Gitlet:
    o	This is the main class that calls the constructor of the gitlet. It contains the current branch and the current ID used. 

•	Branch: 
    o	This is where the branch constructors are. It is built up of commits and contains the current commit. We want it to possibly be a doubley linked list so that the branches are never cut off/ floating if there is a command to rebase or ____.

•	Commands:
    o	This class holds all of the Gitlet command methods. (Add, RM, Log, Find, Checkout… etc.) 
    o	There is a method at the end that allows us to check what string the user inputted and which method to call. 
    o	There will be a call to the commands constructor within Gitlet which calls the command methods. 

•	Commit:
    o	It creates/ saves all of the commits
    o	Creates a unique ID for each commit and keeps track of all the ID’s used. Will assign the parent and child(maybe) commits too. 
    o	Contains a list of strings that have the modified and non-modified files.
